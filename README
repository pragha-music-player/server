PaghaServer..

Pragha is not dead, but the days of hoarding MP3 files with all your friends to
make a big collection maybe yes..

At the request of a boss, I've been working on an Ampache plugin for Pragha (See
https://github.com/pragha-music-player/pragha/pull/90 for details), and now that
I buy a new computer (good processor, good memory, good screen), but a disk with
small size (although fast of course), can not keep my collection there.

On the other hand, I have a computer running as a server. Why not put my music
there?

Until now is only compatible with the Ampache's XML API, and implements only the
methods that Pragha uses, but the idea is to implement a new API, which fits
more to the interests of Pragha, and write a new plugin for it.

p.s: NAME OF FEW IDEAS!.
